# Rock-Paper-Scissors-v1
Initial development of the common Rock Paper Scissors game in python as I was learning it during a class in High School.

- Each run encompasses one round of Rock Paper Scissors.
- The user is prompted if they want the computer to respond randomly or not. If the user responds no, the program is hard-coded to win no matter what the user input is.
- If the user chooses to have the computer respond randomly, the user is then prompted to input their choice (rock, paper, scissors) and the program will pick a random choice and display the appropriate response.
- There is input validation, ensuring that only the desired inputs are accepted.
